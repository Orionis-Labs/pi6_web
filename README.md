Inspiration:-
The Ethereum ecosystem has dashboards like Zapper, Zerion etc to manage all things related to DeFi. But the Cosmos ecosystem lacks any such tool. There has been a demand for a specific tool to keep track of all the airdrops, to get notified about up and coming proposals. Hence we wanted to bridge the gap by providing such tool to the community. We also want to make it such that newcomers won't feel it as a barricade for their entry to the Cosmos ecosystem.

What it does:-
The user will be able to manage their portfolio, check up and coming airdrops, check proposals and be notified whenever a new proposal is up. To do all these, the user just has to enter his wallet address.

How we built it:-
We used React for the web frontend and Flutter for Mobile frontend. To store the airdrops details, we have used Firebase Firestore and to get blockchain specific data, we used APIs provided by certain validators.

What's next for Pi6 Finance:-
This is just an MVP, we are planning to further improve it so that it can be used by everyone. We are also planning to include the ability of connecting with Keplr extension and also the ability of creating wallets and transacting through the app itself.

Built With :- 
Dart, Firebase, Flutter, Javascript, React
